Binary to Decimal Converter is a simple interface to convert binary numbers to their decimal representation.
The app is built with:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

You can see a live preview of the app [here][live-preview].

## Motivation
The idea behind this app was taken from [Florin Pop's App Ideas GitHub repository][app-ideas-repo].

## Future
Add [bignumber.js][bignumber-js-link] support, as currently this app loses accuracy when using large integers.
Noticed [RapidTables][rapidtables-binary-to-decimal-converter] use this in their calculator to fix this problem.
